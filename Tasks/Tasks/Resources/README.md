# Tasks Theming

## Introduction

Today's project is to take the Tasks app we've previously worked on an apply a theme to it using the concepts you learned today.

This project is more open ended than most afternoon projects. You're allowed to come up with your own theme. 

## Instructions

Please fork and clone this repository. It contains a completed version of the Tasks guided project.

Take a few minutes to come up with a theme you want to apply to this application. If you need some inspiration and ideas, pttrns.com can be a great resource for UI design examples.

This project should use:

- `UIAppearance` to style the UI elements that would have the same style applied on every view controller (e.g. navigation bars, table view cells, and other system controls.)
- At least one custom font. [This page](https://www.1001fonts.com/free-fonts-for-commercial-use.html) has fonts to download that are free for personal and commercial use.
- The text in your app should scale when the user uses non-default font sizes on their device. (Dynamic Type)


## Go Further

Customize the application even more by:

- Using custom cells to display more information about the notes.
- Create an app icon and add it to the app.
- Create a logo image and place it in the navigation bar (like Instagram)
